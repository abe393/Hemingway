Journaling App
Master plan and things i need to do:

I want to create an app that just for you a personal journal in app form but also be a learning opportunity.


Brainstorming:

Set up database on EC2 instance.
    - design a database to store picture and journal entries. 
    - Currently looking at Mysql for database mayve the journal entry can be a document store maybe i can look into graphQL could be a cool skill to pickup. 
    - S3 for pictures. 

Backend 
- right now the backend is flask used it once at a pervious job. 

UI 
- I need to overhaul the UI. Maybe a tumblr style for pictures would be good. I look into how to do a better journaling portion as well.  Not sure about the home page either. Maybe it should be the latest media from each section.
